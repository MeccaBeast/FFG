                    <p1>Arsenal Football Club is a professional football club based in Islington, London, England, that plays in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. The Club has won 13 League titles, a record 13 FA Cups, 2 League Cups, 15 FA Community Shields, 1 League Centenary Trophy, 1 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and 1 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.<br><br>

                        Arsenal was the first club from the South of England to join The Football League, in 1893, and they reached the First Division in 1904. Relegated only once, in 1913, they continue the longest streak in the top division, and have won the second-most top-flight matches in English football history. In the 1930s, Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups, and another FA Cup and two Championships after the war. In 1970 &#45 71, they won their first League and FA Cup Double. Between 1989 and 2005, they won five League titles and five FA Cups, including two more Doubles. They completed the 20th century with the highest average league position.<br><br>
                        
                        Herbert Chapman won Arsenal's first national trophies, but died prematurely. He helped introduce the WM formation, floodlights, and shirt numbers, and added the white sleeves and brighter red to the club's kit. Ars&egravene Wenger was the longest-serving manager and won the most trophies. He won a record 7 FA Cups, and his title-winning team set an English record for the longest top-flight unbeaten league run at 49 games between 2003 and 2004, receiving the nickname The Invincibles.<br><br>
                        
                        In 1886, Woolwich munitions workers founded the club as Dial Square. In 1913, the club crossed the city to Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, becoming close neighbours of Tottenham Hotspur, and creating the North London derby. In 2006, they moved to the nearby Emirates Stadium. In terms of revenue, Arsenal is the ninth highest-earning football club in the world, earned &#8364 487.6m in 2016&#4517 season. Based on social media activity from 2014 to 2015, Arsenal's fanbase is the fifth largest in the world. In 2018, Forbes estimated the club was the third most valuable in England, with the club being worth &#36 2.24 billion.</p1>

                <p1>Brighton & Hove Albion Football Club, commonly referred to as Brighton, is an English professional football club based in the city of Brighton. They compete in the Premier League, the top tier of the English football league system. The club's home ground is the 30,750 &#45 capacity Falmer Stadium, situated in Falmer to the north east of the city.<br><br>

                    Founded in 1901, and nicknamed the "Seagulls" or "Albion", Brighton played their early professional football in the Southern League, before being elected to the Football League in 1920. The club enjoyed greatest prominence between 1979 and 1983 when they played in the First Division and reached the 1983 FA Cup Final, losing to Manchester United after a replay. They were relegated from the First Division in the same season.<br><br>
                    
                    By the late 1990s, Brighton had slipped to the fourth tier of English football and were in financial trouble. After narrowly avoiding relegation from the Football League to the Conference in 1997, a boardroom takeover saved the club from liquidation. Successive promotions in 2001 and 2002 brought Brighton back to the second tier, and in 2011, the club moved into the Falmer Stadium after 14 years without a permanent home ground. In the 2016 &#45 17 season, Brighton finished second in the EFL Championship and were thus promoted to the Premier League, ending a 34 &#45 year absence from the top flight.</p1>

                <p1>Burnley Football Club is a professional association football club based in Burnley, Lancashire, England. Founded on 18 May 1882, the team originally played only friendly matches until they entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1885 &#45 86. The club currently plays in the Premier League, the first tier of English football. Nicknamed the Clarets, due to the dominant colour of their home shirts, they were one of the twelve founding members of the Football League in 1888. The club's emblem is based on the town's crest, with a Latin motto Pretiumque et Causa Laboris ("The Prize and the Cause of Our Labour").<br><br>

                    Burnley have been champions of England twice, in 1920-21 and 1959 &#45 60, have won the FA Cup once, in 1914, and have won the Community Shield twice, in 1960 and 1973. The Clarets also reached the 1961 quarter-finals of the European Cup. They are one of only five teams to have won all top four professional divisions of English football, along with Wolverhampton Wanderers, Preston North End, Sheffield United and Portsmouth.<br><br>
                    
                    In the 1920 &#45 21 campaign, Burnley were crowned champions of England for the first time when they won the First Division. During that season the team embarked on a 30-match unbeaten run, which remained an English record until it was beaten by Nottingham Forest in the late 1970s. Burnley attained a second league championship in 1959 &#45 60 with a team consisting of mostly youth academy graduates, winning the title with a last-day victory over Manchester City, after foundations were laid by pioneers Alan Brown, Bob Lord and Harry Potts.<br><br>
                    
                    Just twenty years later, in 1979 &#45 80, Burnley were relegated to the Third Division - the first time in their history they had played in the third tier of English football. Five years later, the team competed in the Fourth Division for the first time following another relegation, and on 9 May 1987 only a 2 &#45 1 home win against Orient saved Burnley from relegation to the Football Conference and a possible dissolution. Burnley won promotion in 1991-92 to the third tier and again in 1999-2000 to the second tier, before being promoted to the Premier League in 2008 &#45 09, 2013 &#45 14 and 2015 &#45 16.<br><br>
                    Burnley have played home games at Turf Moor since 17 February 1883, after the club had moved from their original premises at Calder Vale. The club colours of claret and blue were adopted prior to the 1910-11 season in tribute to the dominant club of English football at the time, Aston Villa. Their current manager, Sean Dyche, was appointed on 30 October 2012.

                <p1>Crystal Palace Football Club is an English professional football club based in Selhurst, South London, that competes in the Premier League, the highest level of English football. They were founded in 1905 at the famous Crystal Palace Exhibition building and played their home games at the FA Cup Final stadium situated inside the historic Palace grounds. The club were forced to leave the Palace in 1915 due to the outbreak of the First World War, and played at Herne Hill Velodrome and the Nest until 1924, when they moved to their current home at Selhurst Park.<br><br>

                    Palace were elected to the Football League in 1920 and have overall spent the majority of their time competing in the top two leagues of English football. Since 1964, they have only dropped below the second tier once, for three seasons between 1974 and 1977. Palace enjoyed a successful period in the top flight in the late 1980s and early 1990s, during which they achieved their highest ever league finish in 1990-91 of third place in the old First Division, now known as the Premier League, and were only denied a place in Europe because of the partial UEFA ban on English clubs at that time following the Heysel Stadium disaster. The club became one of the original founding members of the Premier League. It was also during this period that Palace reached the 1990 FA Cup Final. Palace set two unwanted Premier League records for relegation, in 1992-93 they were relegated on 49 points, which is still a record number of points for a relegated Premier League club and are also the only club ever to be relegated from the Premier League even though they finished fourth from bottom in 1994-95, as it had been decided that at the end of that season the league would be reduced in size from 22 to 20 clubs. The club suffered severe financial problems towards the end of the 1990s and into the 2000s, and went into administration twice in 1999 and 2010. Palace recovered and gained promotion back to the Premier League in 2012-13 where they have remained ever since and they reached another FA Cup final in 2016.<br><br>
                    
                    The club's traditional kit colours were originally claret and blue, but in 1973 they decided to change to the red and blue vertical stripes now worn today. Palace have a fierce rivalry with Brighton & Hove Albion, with whom they contest the M23 derby and also share rivalries with fellow South London clubs Millwall and Charlton Athletic.</p1>

The club has competed in the top division for a record 116 seasons, missing the top division only four times (1930-31, 1951-52, 1952-53, and 1953-54) since The Football League was created in 1888. The club has won the League Championship nine times (fourth most), the FA Cup five times (ninth most), and the UEFA Cup Winners Cup once.<br><br>

                        Formed in 1878, Everton was a founding member of The Football League in 1888 and won its first League Championship two seasons later. Following four League Championship and two FA Cup wins, Everton experienced a lull in the immediate post World War II period, until a revival in the 1960s saw the club win two League Championships and an FA Cup. The mid-1980s represented its most recent period of sustained success, with two League Championships, an FA Cup, and the 1985 European Cup Winners' Cup. The club's most recent major trophy was the 1995 FA Cup.<br><br>
                        
                        The club's supporters are known as Evertonians. Everton has a rivalry with Liverpool, and the two sides contest the Merseyside derby. The club has been based at Goodison Park in Walton since 1892, after moving from Anfield following a row over its rent. The club's home colours are royal blue shirts with white shorts and socks.</p1>

                <p1>Leicester City Football Club is an English professional football club based in Leicester in the East Midlands. The club competes in the Premier League, England's top division of football, and plays its home games at the King Power Stadium.<br><br>

                    The club was founded in 1884 as Leicester Fosse F.C., playing on a field near Fosse Road. They moved to Filbert Street in 1891, were elected to the Football League in 1894 and adopted the name Leicester City in 1919. They moved to the nearby Walkers Stadium in 2002, which was renamed the King Power Stadium in 2011.<br><br>
                    
                    Leicester won the 2015-16 Premier League, their first top-level football championship. They are one of only six clubs to have won the Premier League since its inception in 1992. A number of newspapers described Leicester's title win as the greatest sporting shock ever, considering at the start of the season they were favourites to face relegation. Multiple bookmakers had never paid out at such long odds for any sport. As a result, the team was dubbed "The Unbelievables", a spin-off harking back to Arsenal's undefeated team "The Invincibles". The club's previous highest ever finish was second place in the top flight, in 1928-29, then known as Division One. Throughout Leicester's history, they have spent all but one season in the top two leagues of English football. They hold a joint-highest seven second-tier titles (six Second Division and one Championship).<br><br>
                    
                    The club have been FA Cup finalists four times, in 1948-49, 1960-61, 1962-63 and 1968-69. This is a tournament record for the most defeats in the final without having won the competition. Leicester have several promotions to their name, two play-off final wins, and one League One title. In 1971, they won the FA Community Shield, and in 2016, they were runners-up. The club have won the League Cup three times in 1964, 1997 and 2000, as well as being runners-up in 1965 and 1999. Leicester City have also competed in European football, featuring in the 1961-62 European Cup Winners' Cup, 1997-98 UEFA Cup, 2000-01 UEFA Cup, and most recently the 2016-17 UEFA Champions League, reaching the quarter-finals of the competition in that year.</p1>

                    Founded in 1892, the club joined the Football League the following year and has played at Anfield since its formation. Liverpool established itself as a major force in English and European football in the 1970s and 1980s when Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish led the club to a combined eleven League titles and four European Cups. Under the management of Rafael Ben&#237tez and captained by homegrown player Steven Gerrard, Liverpool became European champions for the fifth time in 2005 before adding a sixth crown under J&#252rgen Klopp in 2019.<br><br>

                    The club's supporters have been involved in two major tragedies: the Heysel Stadium disaster, where escaping fans were pressed against a collapsing wall at the 1985 European Cup Final in Brussels, with 39 people - mostly Italians and Juventus fans - dying, after which English clubs were given a five-year ban from European competition, and the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, where 96 Liverpool supporters died in a crush against perimeter fencing.<br><br>
                    
                    The team changed from red shirts and white shorts to an all-red home strip in 1964 which has been used ever since. Red has been the main shirt colour ever since 1896. The club's anthem is "You'll Never Walk Alone".</p1>

The club's most successful period was between 1904 and 1910, when they won an FA Cup and three of their First Division titles. The club was relegated in 2009 and 2016, but returned to the Premier League for the 2017-18 season.<br><br>
                        
                        Newcastle has a local rivalry with Sunderland, with whom they have contested the Tyne-Wear derby since 1898. The club's traditional kit colours are black and white striped shirts, black shorts and black socks. Their crest has elements of the city coat of arms, which features two grey seahorses. Before each home game, the team enters the field to "Local Hero", and "Blaydon Races" is also sung during games.<br><br>
                        
                        The club has been owned by Mike Ashley since 2007, succeeding long-term chairman Sir John Hall. The club is the 17th-highest revenue producing club in the world in terms of annual revenue, generating &#8364 169.3 million in 2015. Newcastle's highest placing was in 1999, when they were the fifth-highest revenue producing football club in the world, and second in England only behind Manchester United.</p1>

                    <p1>Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, commonly referred to as Tottenham or Spurs, is an English professional football club in Tottenham, London, that competes in the Premier League. Tottenham Hotspur Stadium has been the club's home ground since April 2019, replacing their former home of White Hart Lane, which had been demolished to make way for the new stadium on the same site.

Tottenham have played in a first (home) strip of white shirts and navy blue shorts since the 1898-99 season.

                        Founded in 1882, Tottenham won the FA Cup for the first time in 1901, the only non-League club to do so since the formation of the Football League in 1888. Tottenham were the first club in the 20th century to achieve the League and FA Cup Double, winning both competitions in the 1960-61 season. After successfully defending the FA Cup in 1962, in 1963 they became the first British club to win a UEFA club competition - the European Cup Winners' Cup. They were also the inaugural winners of the UEFA Cup in 1972, becoming the first British club to win two different major European trophies. They have collected at least one major trophy in each of the six decades from the 1950s to 2000s - an achievement only matched by Manchester United. In total, Spurs have won two league titles, eight FA Cups, four League Cups, seven FA Community Shields, one European Cup Winners' Cup and two UEFA Cups. Tottenham were also the runners-up of the 2018-19 UEFA Champions League competition.

                    <p1>Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club, commonly known as Wolves, is an English professional football club in Wolverhampton, West Midlands. Formed as St Luke's F.C. in 1877, they have played at Molineux Stadium since 1889 and compete in the Premier League, the top division of English football, after winning the 2017-18 EFL Championship. Wolves will compete in the 2019-20 UEFA Europa League, the first time the club has qualified for a European tournament for thirty-nine years, by virtue of finishing in seventh-place in the 2018-19 Premier League in their first season back in the top tier.<br><br>

                        Wolves were one of the founding members of the Football League in 1888. The club in 2018-19 enjoyed its 64th season of top flight football; Wolves's longest continuous period in the top tier was 26 consecutive seasons in the 33 years between 1932 to 1965 (n.b. there was no league football between 1939 and 1946 due to World War II). In the 1950s, Wolves were English League champions three times (1953-54, 1957-58 and 1958-59), under the management of Stan Cullis. Wolves have also finished League runners-up on five occasions, most recently in 1959-60.<br><br>
                        
                        Wolves have won the FA Cup four times, most recently in 1960, and finished runners-up on a further four occasions. The club has also won the Football League Cup twice, in 1974 and 1980.<br><br>
                        
                        In 1953, Wolves was one of the first British clubs to install floodlights, taking part in televised "floodlit friendlies" against leading overseas club sides between 1953 and 1956 in the run-up to the creation of the European Cup in 1955 and the first participation of an English club side in that competition in 1956. Wolves reached the quarter-finals of the 1959-60 European Cup and the semi-finals of the 1960-61 European Cup Winners' Cup, and were runners-up to Tottenham Hotspur in the inaugural 1972 UEFA Cup Final.<br><br>
                        
                        Wolves' traditional kit consists of gold shirts and black shorts and the club badge one or more wolves. Wolves have long-standing rivalries with other West Midlands clubs, the main one being with West Bromwich Albion, against whom they contest the Black Country derby, although the two clubs have not met in a League fixture since 2011-12, the last season they competed in the same division.</p1>
